# MEANTest

### Step 1
Create a presentable UI to the user to add, remove, update, and delete series on a single-page application.

### Step 2
Update the existing code to use Mongoose as the database driver instead of MongoClient [Mongoose](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose)

### Step 3
Develop schemas to represent your data (Object Data Model)

The overall goal is to demonstrate your knowledge on basic CRUD operations through the use of two-way data binding, observables, promises, Angular directives, and the use of MongoDB.

Be sure to run npm install and ensure you have MongoDB installed and are running mongod somewhere before attempting to run `node server`
Ex. `mongod --dbpath="data"`

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
